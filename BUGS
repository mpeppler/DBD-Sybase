Known problems:
--------------

t/fail.t fails on test 8 if the server is 11.0.3.3. This is not a problem 
with DBD::Sybase, but rather a problem with the error handling of
the Sybase server itself.

Prepared statements with ?-style placeholders become unusable after
an error on the execute, with an error similar to: 
     Stored procedure '*00001500000000_70d40f' not found.
This error shows up when DBD::Sybase is used against some versions
of ASE 12.0 (known versions to be affected are 12.0 ESD#1 and ESD#2,
and 12.0.0.1 ESD#3 on Solaris.)
On ASE 11.9.2/linux $sth->execute() calls that follow the call that 
fails simply hang.
